I make connection to the JSON Placeholder.

Practice how to use CRUD with JavaScript.

Added the ability for the user to select and interact with the method of sending to the server.
Make content editable.
Add PUT and DELETE methods to request.
Also added page content update from JSON server data.


Unpretentious style included!
